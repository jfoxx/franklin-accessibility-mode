![Alt Text](docs/a11y-mode-demo.gif)

A sidekick extension that integrates with [Sa11y](https://sa11y.netlify.app/) to check the page from an accessibility perspective, and provides suggestions on things that can be improved. 

Custom checks can added based on the project and/or block requirements. These can be useful to promote correct usage of blocks or adhere to style guidelines.
